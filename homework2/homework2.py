# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
#git bash is the terminal we use to run git, git hub is like an online "cloud " that stores code, and git is the version control system we use to navigate our folders/directories

# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
#terminal is the software interface that can be used to run typed command lines to navigate files and directories

# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
#Windows powershell uses a different language than Git Bash, which is more similar to Apple's unix language.

# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
#python is the fundamental language that Anaconda and conda operate on. Conda is a management system, while anaconda is python tailored for data science and machine learning.

# 5) What is VS Code?
#VS Code is a website we use to run and edit python scripts to help debug.

# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
#A Jupiter notebook is used to create and share documents of code. Jupyter notebook is a feature of Jupyter lab, which is a web-based user interface for Python.

# 7) What does ~/ mean?
# The ~ symbol means you're at the "home" or starting point of your command line, otherwise known as your home directory.

# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
#Absolute paths show location from the home directory, while relative paths show location based on the file/folder you're currently in.

# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
#Absolte: ~/python_decal_fa25/course_assignments/homework2.py  Relative: ../course_assignments/homework2.py

# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
#cd ..

# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
#it would delete the current directory or file

# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add = git add puts the file or directory in a staging area where it prepares the file to be saved
# git commit = git commit saves the contents of the file to the local repository
# git push = git push pushes the saved contents of the file to a remote repository

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
#git add puts all changes in the staging area while git add <file> only places the changes made to the specified file into the staging area

# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
#git status displays the status of your changes, whether saved or unsaved, as well as the name of your current branch. Git log-1 displays the most recent commit in the branch's history.

# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
#pulling a respository brings it from the remote repository to your local repository. Cloning a repository copies it onto your local machine, but doens't allow you to make remote changes to it.

# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
#My most frustrating bug was when I was trying to connect my local and remote repositories through github. There were multiple errors, including the fact that the repositories didn't match, but I went to office hours and learned how to pull files and use rebase to make the repositories match.

# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
#I'm still not sure what a Jupyter notebook or lab is because we've never used them in class.

# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
#the ancient Minoan peoples used to jump/frontflip over bulls for sport (courtesy of my archeaology class)

# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
x = 10%4
print (x)
#the percentage symbol prints the remainder of a division problem.
