#I have no idea what insollim, spectype, metratio, insolerr, and orbenccenlim are


#Planet Name
#pl_name
#planet name most commonly used in literature
#this parameter gives the name of the planet


#host name
#hostname
#Stellar name most commonly used in the literature
#the name of the stellar object (star) the exoplanet orbits/is hosted by


#discovery method
#discoverymethod
#Method by which the planet was first identified
#the reason the scientists discovered the exoplanet


#spectral type
#st_spectype
#Classification of the star based on their spectral characteristics following the Morgan-Keenan system
#classifying stars based on temperature with hottest O, B, A, F, G, K, M, L to coldest


#equilibrium temperature
#pl_eqt
#The equilibrium temperature of the planet as modeled by a black body heated only by its host star, or for directly imaged planets, the effective temperature of the planet required to match the measured luminosity if the planet were a black body
#state where absorbed energy equals emitted energy (acts as a blackbody)


#planet mass or mass*sin(i) [jupiter mass]
#pl_bmassj
#Minimum mass of a planet as measured by radial velocity, measured in units of masses of Jupiter
#mass measured using the "wobble" of the star in its orbit (changes in radial velocity) represented in units of the mass of jupiter

#different discovery methods are transit, radial velocity, and imaging
#the most common method is transit with 52, while the least is imaging with only 2. Radial velocity is in the middle with 13
#radial velocity is when exoplanets are spotted based on changes in a sun's motion
#imaging uses telescopes to capture faint light of planets as they orbit their host star
#transit involved finding exoplanets through noting a dip in the stars brighness as the exoplanet orbits the star
